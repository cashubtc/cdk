# Development Guide

This guide will help you set up your development environment for working with the CDK repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Git installed on your system
- GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with command line operations

## Initial Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Navigate to the CDK repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Clone your forked repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cdk.git
cd cdk
```

### 2. Install Nix

-->

CDK uses [Nix](https://nixos.org/explore.html) for building, CI, and managing dev environment.
Note: only `Nix` (the language & package manager) and not the NixOS (the Linux distribution) is needed.
Nix can be installed on any Linux distribution and macOS.

While Nix is preferred as it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment
for all developers, it is not strictly required to use Nix to build CDK.

### Install Nix

You have 2 options to install nix:

* **RECOMMENDED:** The [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
* [The official installer](https://nixos.org/download.html)

Example:

```
> nix --version
nix (Nix) 2.9.1
```

The exact version might be different.

### Enable nix flakes

If you installed Nix using the "determinate installer" you can skip this step. If you used the "official installer", edit either `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` or `/etc/nix/nix.conf` and add:

```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

If the Nix installation is in multi-user mode, donâ€™t forget to restart the nix-daemon.

## Alternative Setup Without Nix

While Nix is preferred as it ensures a consistent and reproducible environment
for all developers, it is not strictly required to use Nix to build CDK. You can
also set up your environment manually.

### Installing Rust via rustup

To build CDK without Nix, you'll need to install Rust manually:

1. Install rustup by following the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. Once rustup is installed, you can install the required Rust version:
```bash
rustup install stable
rustup default stable
```

3. Install required tools:
```bash
# For building cdk-mintd, you'll need protobuf compiler
# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install protobuf

# On other systems, please refer to your package manager or
# https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/
```

### Building and Running CDK Components

#### Building cdk-cli

To build the CDK command-line interface:
```bash
cargo build --bin cdk-cli --release
```

To run cdk-cli directly without building:
```bash
cargo run --bin cdk-cli -- --help
```

#### Building cdk-mintd

To build the CDK mint server:
```bash
cargo build --bin cdk-mintd --release
```

To run cdk-mintd directly without building:
```bash
cargo run --bin cdk-mintd
```

Note: For cdk-mintd, you need to have the protobuf compiler installed as it's required for some dependencies.

## Use Nix Shell

```sh
  nix develop -c $SHELL  
```

## Regtest Environment

For testing and development, CDK provides a complete regtest environment with Bitcoin, Lightning Network nodes, and CDK mints.

### Quick Start
```bash
just regtest  # Starts full environment with mprocs TUI
```

This provides:
- Bitcoin regtest node
- 4 Lightning Network nodes (2 CLN + 2 LND)
- 2 CDK mints (one connected to CLN, one to LND)
- Real-time log monitoring via mprocs
- Helper commands for testing Lightning payments and CDK operations

### Comprehensive Guide
See [REGTEST_GUIDE.md](REGTEST_GUIDE.md) for complete documentation including:
- Detailed setup and usage instructions
- Development workflows and testing scenarios
- mprocs TUI interface guide
- Troubleshooting and advanced usage

## Common Development Tasks

### Building the Project
```sh
just build
```

### Running Unit Tests
```bash
just test
```

### Running Integration Tests
```bash
just itest REDB/SQLITE/MEMORY
```

NOTE: if this command fails on macos change the nix channel to unstable (in the `flake.nix` file modify `nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-24.11";` to `nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";`)

### Running Format
```bash
just format
```


### Running Clippy
```bash
just clippy
```

### Running final check before commit
```sh
just final-check
```


## Best Practices

1. **Branch Management**
   - Create feature branches from `main`
   - Use descriptive branch names: `feature/new-feature` or `fix/bug-description`

2. **Commit Messages**
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - Begin with type: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.
   - Provide clear, concise descriptions

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests for new features
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
   - Include integration tests where applicable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Development Shell Issues**
   - Clean Nix store: `nix-collect-garbage -d`
   - Remove and recreate development shell

### Getting Help

- Open an issue on GitHub
- Check existing issues for similar problems
- Include relevant error messages and system information
- Reach out in Matrix [Invite link](https://matrix.to/#/#dev:matrix.cashu.space)

## Contributing

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests and formatting
4. Submit a pull request
5. Wait for review and address feedback

## Backporting Changes

CDK uses an automated backport bot to help maintain stable release branches. This section explains how the backport process works.

### How the Backport Bot Works

The backport bot creates pull requests to backport merged changes from `main` to stable release branches. **You control which branches to backport to by adding labels to your PR.**

**Available Target Branches:**
- `v0.10.x`
- `v0.11.x`
- `v0.12.x`
- `v0.13.x`

### Using Backport Labels

To backport a PR to specific stable branches, add labels to your PR **before or after merging**:

**Label Format:**
- `backport v0.13.x` - backports to v0.13.x branch
- `backport v0.12.x` - backports to v0.12.x branch
- Add multiple labels to backport to multiple branches

**Example Workflow:**
1. Create and merge your PR to `main`
2. Add label `backport v0.13.x` to the PR
3. The bot automatically creates a backport PR for the v0.13.x branch
4. Review and merge the backport PR
5. Repeat for other branches as needed

**When to Add Labels:**
- Add labels before merging - backport PRs are created automatically on merge
- Add labels after merging - backport PRs are created when you add the label
- You can add multiple backport labels at once

### When Backports Fail

Sometimes the backport bot cannot automatically create a backport PR due to merge conflicts or other issues. When this happens:

1. The bot automatically creates a GitHub issue labeled with `backport`
2. The issue will contain details about the original PR and which branch(es) failed
3. You'll need to manually create the backport PR for the failed branch

**Manual Backporting Process:**
```bash
# Checkout the target stable branch
git checkout v0.13.x
git pull origin v0.13.x

# Create a new branch for the backport
git checkout -b backport-pr-NUMBER-to-v0.13.x

# Cherry-pick the commits from the original PR
git cherry-pick COMMIT_HASH

# Resolve any conflicts if they occur
# Then push and create a PR
git push origin backport-pr-NUMBER-to-v0.13.x
```

### Best Practices for Backporting

1. **Label Appropriately:** Only add backport labels for changes that should be in stable branches
2. **Keep PRs Focused:** Smaller, focused PRs are easier to backport automatically
3. **Review Backport PRs:** Always review automatically created backport PRs to ensure they're appropriate
4. **Test Backports:** Run tests on backport PRs just like regular PRs
5. **Address Conflicts Promptly:** If a backport fails, address it promptly or close the issue with an explanation

### When NOT to Backport

Not all changes should be backported to stable branches. **Don't add backport labels** for:
- Breaking API changes
- New features that aren't needed in older versions
- Changes that don't apply to older version branches
- Large refactorings
- Experimental or unstable features

If a backport isn't appropriate, simply don't add the backport label to the PR.
