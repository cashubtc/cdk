# Build Status - Spark CDK Integration

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Last Action**: Attempted build with GNU toolchain  
**Status**: ⚠️ Build tools required  
**Code**: ✅ 100% Complete and committed

## 🔴 CURRENT BLOCKER: Windows Build Tools

### What Was Tried

1. ✅ Rust installed (cargo 1.86.0)
2. ❌ MSVC build → Failed (needs Visual Studio C++ Build Tools)
3. ✅ GNU toolchain installed (stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu)
4. ❌ GNU build → Failed (needs MinGW dlltool.exe)

### The Problem

Windows Rust compilation requires either:
- **MSVC toolchain** = Visual Studio Build Tools (3-5 GB download)
- **GNU toolchain** = MinGW tools (lighter, but still requires dlltool)

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Choose One Path

### 🟢 RECOMMENDED: Use WSL (Easiest, No Windows Build Issues)

If you have WSL installed:

```bash
# In WSL terminal
cd /mnt/c/Users/JuanPabloGaviria/git/cdk
cargo build --package cdk-mintd --features spark --release

# Binary at: target/release/cdk-mintd
# Then run: ./target/release/cdk-mintd --config test-spark-mint.toml
```

**Why**: No Windows build tool issues, faster, more reliable

### 🟡 ALTERNATIVE: Install Visual Studio Build Tools

**Pros**: Most compatible with Windows Rust ecosystem  
**Cons**: Large download (3-5 GB), takes 15-30 minutes

```bash
# File already downloaded: vs_buildtools.exe
# Run it manually:
# 1. Double-click vs_buildtools.exe
# 2. Select "Desktop development with C++"
# 3. Click Install
# 4. Wait 15-30 minutes
# 5. Restart terminal

# Then:
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
cd C:/Users/JuanPabloGaviria/git/cdk
cargo build --package cdk-mintd --features spark --release
```

### 🟡 ALTERNATIVE: Install MinGW for GNU Toolchain

**Pros**: Lighter than Visual Studio  
**Cons**: Additional setup complexity

```bash
# Install MinGW via chocolatey
choco install mingw

# Or download from: https://www.mingw-w64.org/
# Then add to PATH and retry build
```
