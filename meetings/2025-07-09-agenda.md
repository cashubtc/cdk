## Discuss
 - outbox table
     - outbox pattern by inserting a row into an "outbox" table that contains the message to be sent to the LNBackend. Another process will select pending entries from this outbox and dispatch the message to the LN API. Once the message is successfully delivered, we need to update the entry in the outbox table and set its state to completed or failed, depending on the outcome.
